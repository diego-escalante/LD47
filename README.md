# Ludum Dare 47: Chronic Curse

This repo houses my game submission for Ludum Dare 47. The Ludum Dare Compo is an event where you create a game from scratch in 48 hours based on a theme. The theme for this Ludum Dare was **Stuck in a Loop**.

## Ludum Dare Results

* **Rank**: Chronic Curse's rank in each of the categories out of the **800 compo submissions** for LD47.
* **Precentile**: Because the total number of submissions changes between Ludum Dare events, I like to represent my game's results as percentiles to be able to compare my results across events.
* **Delta**: Represents the increase or decrease in percentile compared to the previous Ludum Dare event that I participated in. In this case, it was [Friendly Fire](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/46/friendly-fire).
